# algorithms
This repository contains small project done during AiSD course (Algorithms and Data Structures) at Bachelor Studies at WPPT faculty (Fundamental Problems of Technology)

All algorithms and data structeres beside `lista1` are written in vanilla Python

Each list tackles other problem:

1. Queue, Linked Lsit, Cycled List
2. Quicksort, Merge sort, Insertion sort, Dual-pivot Quicksort, Hybrid of all sorts above
3. Binary search, selection algorithms
4. Binary tree, RB tree, Hashmap
5. Priority Queue, Dijkstra algorithm, Kruskal algorithm, Prim algorithm, traveling salesman problem
